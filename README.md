## Overview
CandL Strategy is a candidate-first career service built for the AI era. We combine expert resume rewriting with intelligent market scanning to match you to roles that were posted recently, show urgency, and align tightly with your experience.

## SequelMatch AI
SequelMatch AI is our job‑match engine:
- You send us your resume
- We rewrite it for clarity, impact, and ATS alignment
- We analyze your employment history and skill progression
- We produce a targeted report of high-fit roles posted very recently and actively hiring
- We include per‑role alignment notes and outreach tips so you can move fast

## How It Works
1. Intake: Share your resume and goals (target roles, industries, constraints)
2. Analysis: We map your experience to in‑demand role patterns and keywords
3. Rewrite: We produce an ATS‑optimized resume plus tailored variations by role
4. Match: SequelMatch AI compiles a list of recently posted, high‑urgency roles
5. Action Plan: You get application notes, messaging templates, and next‑step guidance
